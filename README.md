# Smart Brain Backend

Public backend repo for smart brain w/o sensitive content

Used Express.js to handle requests from the Smart Brain frontend
these requests involved validating user credentials, creating new users,
returning the proper user profiles, hashing passwords to keep information 
secure, and basic error checking to ensure that app will not crash or return
sensitive information.
